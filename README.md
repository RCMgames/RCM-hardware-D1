v1.0

* 1.75 by 1.575 inches, 44.45 by 40.0 millimeters
* 2 motors and 2 servos
* battery monitoring
* Qwiic compatible

The goal of this project is to make the cheapest [RCM board](https://github.com/rcmgames).

Program with [RCMv2](https://github.com/rcmgames/rcmv2)

The RCM D1 uses a Wemos D1 mini v4.0.0 esp8266 board. 

Use the AVR versions of JMotor functions not the ESP32 versions.

The RCM D1 was originally created for [PNW Assistive Technology's RC car project](https://github.com/PNW-AT/rc-car-car)
